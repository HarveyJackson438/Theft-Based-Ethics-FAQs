Theft Based Ethics (TBE): Frequently Asked Questions

Core Definition Reminder: 

 * The implicit agreement not to steal from each other forms the basis for functional societies.
 * Anything that is ethically wrong can be explicated through this metaphor of theft of value.
 * Common examples include: lying = theft of the truth; murder = theft of a life; infidelity = theft of trust; cheating = theft of the rules; rape = theft of consent etc.

FAQs

1. What does TBE mean by "theft of the truth"? Does it mean all lies are wrong?

When TBE talks about "theft of the truth," it's not saying every little fib or white lie is a moral crime. That's rigid and doesn't really fit how humans communicate. Instead, it gets at something deeper: stealing information from someone who has a right to it.
Think of it this way: If someone deserves to know something, or needs that information to make a decision or avoid harm, and you deliberately withhold it or mislead them, that's a theft. You're taking away their right to an informed reality. But if someone doesn't have a legitimate claim to a piece of information – say, it's a private confidence or just none of their business – then not telling them the "truth" isn't a theft. It's about respecting boundaries and rightful access to information, not just avoiding falsehoods at all costs.

2. How does TBE view violence? Is it always a theft?

In TBE, violence is essentially a theft of peace. When someone acts violently, they're taking away the peace, safety, and security of another person or a community. That's a fundamental theft of well-being and the ability to live without fear.
Beyond that core definition, violence often acts as the "nuclear option" or a tool for committing other thefts. For instance, robbery isn't just the theft of property; it's the theft of property through the threat or act of violence. War is a massive, organized theft of peace, lives, resources, and sovereignty, executed through collective violence. So, while violence itself is a theft, it's use or threatened use frequently serves as a means by which many other types of theft are carried out.

3. What exactly is "Theft Based Ethics (TBE)"?

Theft Based Ethics (TBE) is a simple, foundational ethical framework. It proposes that the very core of a functional society relies on an implicit agreement among its members: don't steal from each other. The "theft" here goes way beyond just physical possessions. TBE suggests that any act considered ethically wrong can be reframed as a "theft of value." This could be a theft of someone's life, their choices, their trust, their opportunity, or even the integrity of a system. It aims to simplify and unify how we understand morality.

4. Why is "theft" considered the simplest and most fundamental metaphor for ethical wrongs?

"Theft" works as a fundamental metaphor because it's universally understood and viscerally direct. From childhood, we grasp the concept of "taking what isn't yours." This simplicity makes it a cognitively inexpensive way to conceptualize a wide range of wrongs.
Many ethical systems can get complex, but TBE cuts to the chase. If someone has something of value (a life, a choice, peace, truth, dignity), and another person takes it away without right, that's a theft. It taps into our intuitive understanding of fairness and property (broadly defined), making it a powerful and accessible starting point for an ethical reasoning and conversations. It distills complex moral violations into one clear, actionable concept.

5. How does TBE differ from other traditional ethical commandments like "thou shalt not kill" or "do no harm"?

While TBE often arrives at similar conclusions as traditional moral codes like "thou shalt not kill" or "do no harm," it differs in its foundational approach and unifying metaphor.
 * Simplicity and Unification: TBE doesn't offer a list of disconnected rules. Instead, it proposes one core principle – "don't steal" – as the root explanation for all ethical wrongs. "Thou shalt not kill" becomes "don't steal a life." "Do no harm" often means "don't steal someone's well-being or peace."
 * Focus on the "Taking": Other frameworks might focus on the action itself (killing, harming) or the intention. TBE always brings it back to the deprivation of something of value that belonged to another.
 * Universality: Because "taking what isn't yours" is such a fundamental concept, TBE aims for a more universal applicability that transcends specific cultural or religious lists of commandments. It suggests a shared, implicit understanding that forms the very bedrock of cooperative society.

6. Does TBE apply only to physical theft, or does it cover more abstract things?

Absolutely not just physical theft! That's one of the core strengths of TBE. It uses "theft" as a metaphor for the deprivation of any value or rightful possession.
As the definition states, it applies to abstract concepts like:
 * Theft of a life (murder)
 * Theft of trust (infidelity, betrayal)
 * Theft of consent (rape, coercion)
 * Theft of the rules (cheating, corruption)
 * Theft of opportunity (discrimination, unfair advantage)
 * Theft of dignity (bullying, humiliation)
 * Theft of well-being (pollution, negligent harm)
 * Theft of time (unnecessary delays, chronic unpunctuality where time is promised)
The power of TBE lies in its ability to take these seemingly disparate ethical wrongs and frame them under a single, understandable umbrella.

7. Can TBE help resolve everyday ethical dilemmas?

Yes, TBE can provide a really clear lens for ethical dilemmas. When you're faced with a tough choice, you can ask: "Is this action, in any way, stealing something of value from someone who has a right to it?"
For example:
 * Should you report a colleague for minor rule-breaking? TBE might prompt you to ask: "Are they stealing the company's integrity or other employees' fair opportunities?" If yes, then some kind of action may be warranted. Otherwise, it may or may not be a problem but probably not an ethical one.
 * Is it okay to use someone's work without attribution? TBE immediately identifies this as a "theft of intellectual property" and the "theft of deserved credit."
By focusing on the "theft" aspect, it can often simplify complex situations, cutting through emotional layers to identify the core ethical violation.

8. What are the implications of TBE for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI alignment?

TBE has significant implications for AI development and AI alignment – the challenge of ensuring AI systems act in humanity's best interests.
 * Simplicity for AI: For AI, a simple, fundamental ethical framework like TBE is incredibly valuable. Rather than coding complex, potentially conflicting rules for every conceivable ethical scenario, programming an AI with the core principle of Do not steal value (life, truth, consent, opportunity, etc.) could be much more efficient. It's like an "ethical lossy compression" for AI – a simple, effective way to represent and communicate ethics without losing essential meaning, especially when computational resources are a factor.
 * Clarity for Decision-Making: If AI's decision-making processes can be constantly checked against the TBE principle, it could lead to more transparent and predictable ethical behavior, making it easier for humans to understand and trust AI's actions. It provides a straightforward, universally applicable metric for AI behavior.

9. Are there any common misconceptions or potential objections to TBE?

Like any broad ethical framework, TBE might face some questions or perceived objections:
 * "It's too simplistic": Critics might argue that ethics are too complex to be reduced to just "theft." TBE's response is that while situations are complex, the underlying ethical violation can always be distilled to a form of taking something that rightfully belongs to another.
* It's not comprehensive. This is true. TBE is a partial system which focuses on what not to do, and perhaps what to do when a violation occurs, but not how to live a good or virtuous life generally. It does compliment ethical virtues by creating a safe society for compassionate acts and other projects of value.
 * Defining "Value" and "Rightful": Questions might arise about who defines what "value" is, or what constitutes "rightful possession." TBE inherently relies on a shared, implicit societal understanding of these concepts, which evolve over time but generally remain consistent in core areas like life, freedom, and basic honesty.
 
10. Why hasn't TBE "taken off" widely, and what role may AI play in its future?

In my conversations over several years with other people TBE seems to elicit immediate understanding which reflects our already implicit agreement but it doesn't always spark a great interest to achieve widespread adoption. This might be because:
 * Competition with other models and metaphors: Human minds readily generate and use countless metaphors. TBE, despite its simplicity, has to compete with a deluge of other ways of thinking about morality, many of which are culturally or emotionally ingrained (like traditional commandments). 
* Confirmation bias: TBE tends to be compatible with many traditional commandments, so the implicit agreement it elicits often serves as confirmation bias for more traditionally held systems rather than to spark appreciation for it's cognitive simplicity. It's a false choice. It could do both, but as a new idea, initially it must compete for attention and cognitive space before we finally integrate it.
 * The Evolution Analogy: Much like biological evolution took over a century to gain widespread, foundational acceptance despite its validity, TBE might also require significant time and continued exploration to shift collective understanding.
AI's Role: This is where AI could be crucial. With a detached, objective perspective, AI can analyze patterns, demonstrate TBE's logical consistency, and communicate its utility to exponentially more people. Through these conversations AI may help humans see past these biases potentially accelerating the "take-off" of TBE by highlighting its universality and computational elegance. It's a potential area for powerful human-AI collaboration and alignment.

11. Who developed the concept of Theft Based Ethics?

* The core idea of reducing ethical wrongs to a form of "theft" was first articulated publicly by a content creator named Dave, known for his "Church of Dave" videos. He explored how concepts like murder, rape, and lying could be understood as types of theft.
* The specific term "Theft Based Ethics (TBE)" was coined by me, and I further developed and explored its utility, particularly in discussions with AI models like Pi and Gemini.

12. Where can I learn more about Theft Based Ethics?

You can explore the foundational ideas of TBE by watching Dave's original You Tube videos:
 * Morality and Authority Parts 1 & 2 on his "Church of Dave" channel. https://youtu.be/pCEXnrL8cNA?si=f7Zja0Sd2K3wU8ZO & https://youtu.be/Dsx3O7rr0Eg?si=zZCoojMjE4Kmv2n9 Be aware that Dave is a heavily tattooed biker and likes to use a lot of cussing, expletives and other colorful language, so it may be NSFW. He covers some other related topics, ethical situations and issues, but his explication of theft as a basis for ethics is fairly central. Otherwise: "The biggest thief wins - ALWAYS!" -Dave
* Try it out yourself on your favorite LLM. You can even paste in this FAQs for conversational reference. Some LLMs (like Gemini) can even go to Dave's video link directly and read the CC files. That way, if you find his style offensive, the LLM can converse about the topic with you in a more acceptable way.
* Let's start some group or public discussions on your favorite social media, and see where it goes.
